## Repository Archived

This project, **DiabloDungeonTimer**, has been **archived** and is no longer maintained.

### Why is this archived?
- After the release of **Diablo 4**, I initially created this tool to track dungeon run times. However, my interest in the game faded quickly, and I have not maintained or updated the tool since.  
- The tool is **currently not functioning**, and many of the planned features were **never fully implemented**.  
- Given my lack of engagement with the game and the project, I have decided to **archive the repository** rather than leave it in an incomplete and non-working state.  

### Can I still use it?
- The repository remains available for reference and forking, but **no support, fixes, or updates will be provided**.  
- If anyone wishes to take over development, they are free to fork the project.  

Thanks to everyone who showed interest in **DiabloDungeonTimer**.

# DiabloDungeonTimer

Software which automatically tracks and times all dungeons entered in Diablo IV.

## Does this violate the Game or Battle.Net ToS?

The Software is, without doubt, fully ToS compliant, the required information is gathered via reading a log file, we aren't interacting with the game process or files in any other way.

## Features

- Automatic Stopwatch for an in progress dungeon
- Tracks dungeons entered and time spent in each dungeon (optionally also across sessions)
- Provides statistics (no. of runs & avg/min/max completion time) for these dungeons (optionally also across sessions)
  
## Planned

- Experience tracking via OCR/Screencapture
- Widget or similiar to display current timer and/or statistics in a way suitable for embedding in gameplay streams/videos

## Installation
