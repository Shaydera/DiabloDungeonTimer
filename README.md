# DiabloDungeonTimer

Software which automatically tracks and times all dungeons entered in Diablo IV.

## Does this violate the Game or Battle.Net ToS?

The Software is, without doubt, fully ToS compliant, the required information is gathered via reading a log file, we aren't interacting with the game process or files in any other way.

## Features

- Automatic Stopwatch for an in progress dungeon
- Tracks dungeons entered and time spent in each dungeon (optionally also across sessions)
- Provides statistics (no. of runs & avg/min/max completion time) for these dungeons (optionally also across sessions)
  
## Planned

- Experience tracking via OCR/Screencapture
- Widget or similiar to display current timer and/or statistics in a way suitable for embedding in gameplay streams/videos

## Installation

You can find precompiled binaries under releases.
